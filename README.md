The purpose of these studies is to examine the correlation between the regeneration of forest structures and the composition of breeding bird communities, with a focus on whether the bird community undergoes changes as the forest succeeds. It has been noted that changes in forest age and structure, such as those resulting from agricultural abandonment or reduced wood harvesting, have impacted bird populations. Specifically, an increase in forest density has led to higher mortality rates for weaker trees, resulting in a decrease and simplification of bird communities. Therefore, it is believed that forest regeneration, such as through harvesting to promote plant diversity, could increase the diversity of birds. The data for this study were collected from the Yale-Myers forest in northeastern Connecticut, United States.
